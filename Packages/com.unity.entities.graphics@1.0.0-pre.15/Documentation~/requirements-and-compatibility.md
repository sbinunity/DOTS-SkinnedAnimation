# Requirements and compatibility

This page contains information on system requirements and compatibility of the Entities Graphics package.

## Render pipeline compatibility

Entities Graphics requires a Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) to function.

| **Render pipeline**                        | **Compatibility**                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in Render Pipeline**               | Not supported                                              |
| **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** | HDRP version 13.0.0 and above, with Unity 2022.1 and above |
| **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**        | URP version 13.0.0 and above, with Unity 2022.1 and above  |

For more information about the supported feature set, see [Entities Graphics feature matrix](entities-graphics-versions.md).

## Unity Player system requirements

This section describes the Entities Graphics packageâ€™s target platform requirements. For platforms or use cases not covered in this section, general system requirements for the Unity Player apply.

For more information, see [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html).

Entities Graphics is not yet tested or supported on [XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html) devices. XR support is intended in a later version.

Entities Graphics does not support ray-tracing (DXR). Ray-tracing support is intended in a later version.

## DOTS feature compatibility

Entities Graphics does not support multiple DOTS [Worlds](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest?subfolder=/manual/world.html). Limited support for multiple Worlds is intended in a later version. The current plan is to add support for creating multiple rendering systems, one per renderable World, but then only have one World active for rendering at once.
