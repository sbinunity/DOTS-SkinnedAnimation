# Sample projects

To explore more use cases of the Hybrid Render, the **EntityComponentSystemSamples** repository contains various samples.

This repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) on Unity Technology's GitHub.

When you clone the Project's repository, make sure to use git or a git client. This is because if you use the Green button on the GitHub website, it does not download all the Assets.

The Entities Graphics sample projects can be found at:

- **HDRP**: [HybridHDRPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/HybridHDRPSamples)
- **URP**: [HybridURPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/HybridURPSamples)

Project folder structure:

- **SampleScenes**: Contains all sample scenes, showcasing the supported features.
- **StressTestScenes**: Contains stress test scenes for benchmarking.
- **Tests**: Graphics tests (for image comparisons).

Sample projects use Entities Graphics and require Unity 2022.1 or later and version 13.0.0 or later of the HDRP and URP packages.
